# Aarya Y. Chandhok – Game Developer & Designer

I am an aspiring game developer and designer with a passion for creating engaging digital experiences that blend creativity, technology, and polish. Proficient in C# with Unity, Python, and with a working knowledge of C++, I enjoy building interactive games and tools that push my skills and curiosity further. My published works are available on the Google Play Store under the developer name “A.Y.N.S.J.C.”, where I have released a growing collection of indie games and applications, each reflecting my commitment to quality and innovation.

## Buggy
Beyond game development, I am the creator and maintainer of “Buggy,” an open source software management tool designed to streamline project workflows and issue tracking. This project showcases my dedication to the open-source community and my interest in developing solutions that help others build better software.

## Google Chrome Home Page
A better home page for google chrome with unlimited shortcuts so you can pin as many websites as you want and group them for better organisation. It has dark theme and can be set up with 'New Tab Redirect' and paste the link of my open source repository.

## CMD-plus-plus
A cmd with basic functionality but easier to use, where you can customize the terms which you use to name things. You can move around your system, create, remove and rename directries, print(echo) things, and have a more user friendly experience.

## Miscellaneous
My technical pursuits also extend into hardware, where I experiment with small electronics and hardware projects, often integrating software and microcontroller programming to create minimalist, functional devices. This hands-on experience with both software and hardware enriches my approach to problem-solving and design.

I am always learning and exploring new technologies, striving to bridge the gap between design and development. My work is guided by a minimalist, professional aesthetic, with a focus on delivering clean, user-friendly, and impactful experiences.
